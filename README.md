# Introduction
An Android app made in 12 hours at a hackathon that can track current location and finds nearest railway stations. The hackathon was an assignment for a university module titled "Advanced Programming" for which I recieved 93/100.

# Core Functionality
- App gets the current geographical location.
- Location data (latitude and longitude) are placed in a query string of a URL that requests from the server via HTTP.
- Server supplys JSON data of nearby railway stations.
- App deserialized the JSON data and displays the results to the user.
- Results can be displayed on the map using MapBox.

# Disclaimer
A few things to mention:
  1. This app was submitted in April 2020, my skills have significantly increased since then.
  2. The app was made in 12 hours from 9am to 9pm, so code quality is probably lower that usual.
